# SRA_Analysis_WDL
- An Auto Pipeline
- Robustness
- Designed for Bio-os

Here, we need a script, a program or an other things, to meet our need. 

What we need?
-----------------------
We have a platform built for fetch raw sequencing data to our system. Once the data is under our gover, we will get our pipline on woring. Given the complexity of the situation, our tools should be packaged as stand-alone toolkits, or they should take advantage of infrastructure that is readily available.


What we have,now
-----------------------
  - 10X Cellranger count WDL
  - 10X Cellranger ATAC count WDL
  - 10X Cellranger VDJ WDL
  - 10X Spaceranger WDL
  - 10X Cellranger multi WDL (for GEX + VDJ-T/VDJ-B or both of them)
  - SeqWell & Drop-seq & BD WDL (STARsolo)
  - SMART-seq WDL (STARsolo, too)
`Praise the god of STAR`


Update
-----------------------
  - 2024.05.04
  - 10X Cellranger multi WDL
